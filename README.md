# Required Installations

To ensure all dependencies are installed correctly, please run the following commands:

### Web Vitals

React has not been installing web vitals by default recently. Install it using:

```sh
npm install web-vitals
```

Babel was required at the start of the project:

Install the required Babel plugin:
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
```
